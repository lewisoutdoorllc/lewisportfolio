I built this site to display a portfolio of myself; there is not much now but I will be adding as I go along. I left the Lorem Ipsum text in as I do not know what to say about myself at this time; I expect by the time I am done with this BootCamp I will have this all filled out and even multiple pages to this expanding portfolio. Please enjoy what I can provide at this time.

Thanks for all the help from Kip my partner on this little venture for making this happen with everything; we spent over 40 hours and finally got this thing ironed out. Cheers..
